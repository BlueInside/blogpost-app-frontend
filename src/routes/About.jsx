        <h1>My Journey: From Gaming Enthusiast to Web Developer</h1>
        <p>
          Hello, everyone! My name is Karol Pulawski, and I&apos;m excited to
          share my journey with you. I hail from the picturesque town of
          Sandomierz in Poland, and at 26 years old, I find myself on an
          exhilarating path into the world of web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          My adventure began about a year and a half ago when I made a pivotal
          decision to explore a new career path. After completing high school, I
          found myself at a crossroads, unsure of what direction to take.
          Seeking clarity, I embarked on a gap year abroad.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my time abroad, I fell into a routine of gaming and work, but
          deep down, I knew I craved something more fulfilling. It wasn&apos;t
          long before I realized that I needed a change. So, I took a leap of
          faith and left my job as a Restaurant Manager, determined to reshape
          my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past few years, I&apos;ve undergone a remarkable
          transformation. I made significant lifestyle changes, including
          quitting smoking and prioritizing my health with regular gym sessions.
          But perhaps my most significant endeavor has been my journey into the
          world of coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          My fascination with coding initially led me to explore game
          development. However, I soon realized the complexities involved,
          especially without prior IT knowledge. Undeterred, I shifted my focus
          to web development after discovering the wealth of resources available
          online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fuelled by determination, I dove headfirst into online courses,
          starting with Colt Steele&apos;s acclaimed Udemy course. Through his
          guidance, I delved into the intricacies of JavaScript and beyond.
          Currently, I&apos;m immersed in the final stages of the Project Odin
          curriculum, eager to refine my skills further.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this blog, I aim to document my experiences and insights as I
          navigate the exciting world of web development. Moreover, I want to
          address a common concern among aspiring programmers: the fear of
          starting late. My journey is proof that it&apos;s never too late to
          pursue your dreams, regardless of age or background.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I continue on this exhilarating journey, I hope to inspire others
          to follow their passions and embrace change. With each challenge and
          triumph, I grow more confident in my abilities and more determined to
          carve out a fulfilling career in web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for joining me on this adventure. Let&apos;s code our way to
          success together!
        </p>
        <p>
          Warm regards,
          <br />
